A year ago, Tokio was a very different library. It includes the (now deprecated)
`tokio-core` which provided a future executor, I/O selector, and basic TCP/UDP
types in a single library. It also included `tokio-proto`, but we won't talk
about that. Over the past year, Tokio has grown to become Rust's asynchronous
I/O platform. It has been adopted by a [number][linkerd] of [large][aws]
[companies][azure] to build [apps][tikv].

[tikv]: https://github.com/tikv/tikv

A lot was achieved in 2018. Some highlights include:

- A high-performance, multi-threaded, work-stealing, scheduler was introduced.
- Timers were rebuilt from the ground up.
- A file system API was introduced.
- UDS, TLS, signals, and other APIs were added to Tokio.
- Most importantly, the Tokio runtime was introduced as a batteries included
  platform upon which asynchronous applications can be built.

This is not including the myriad of smaller improvements. Improvements like
revamped documentation, bug fixes, performance improvements, and refined APIs.
These improvements were contributed by an impressive [165 individual
contributors][contrib].

Indeed, 2018 was a great year for Tokio and it is all thanks to you. That said,
we are just getting started and 2019 is setting up to be even better. I want to
highlight a few big things (already in the works) expected to land in 2019.

## Async / await

Async / await is being built into the Rust language. It enables writing
asynchronous code (almost) as if it were synchronous. This work has been on
going for a while, and should land in Rust stable sometime in 2019. The
implication of async / await is a large ergonomic improvements when using Tokio.

If you are willing to use the Rust nightly compiler, you can use async / await
with Tokio [today][async-await]. In short, depend on `tokio` with the
`async-await-preview` feature and try it out.

Here is a taste:

```rust,ignore
pub fn main() {
    tokio::run_async(async {
        let client = Client::new();

        let uri = "http://httpbin.org/ip".parse().unwrap();

        let response = await!({
            client.get(uri)
                .timeout(Duration::from_secs(10))
        }).unwrap();

        println!("Response: {}", response.status());

        let mut body = response.into_body();

        while let Some(chunk) = await!(body.next()) {
            let chunk = chunk.unwrap();
            println!("chunk = {}", str::from_utf8(&chunk[..]).unwrap());
        }
    });
}
```

[Full example](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/blob/master/tokio-async-await/examples/src/hyper.rs)

So, what is the path for Tokio to fully adopt async/await? Let's talk a bit
about that.

First, async/await has to land on Rust stable. The exact target date is unknown,
but it is expected to happen on 2019. Once this happens, Tokio will immediately
add support in a backwards compatible way. The strategy by which this will
happen is being explored today with the experimental `async-await-preview`
feature flag. At a high level, async/await specific APIs will be added with an
`_async` suffix. For example, `tokio::run_async` will be the way to start the
Tokio runtime using an async fn (or a `std::future::Future`).

Once async/await support has had a moment to mature, Tokio will issue a breaking
change and drop the `_async` suffix. `tokio::run` will take an async function by
default.

What about futures 0.1? We can't immediately drop support for futures 0.1. There
is a growing ecosystem, including production apps, built on top of Tokio and
that includes using futures 0.1. It will take time to transition off. This will
be done in a multi step way.

First, support for async/await is added in a backwards compatible way. This adds
simultaneous support for both async/await **and** futures 0.1. Then, async/await
becomes the primary API and futures 0.1 can be used via a compatibility layer.
This will enable using libraries that haven't been updated yet with the latest
Tokio.

We are sensitive to the fact that change is hard for an established ecosystem
and look forward to discussing the transition process with the community.

A tracking issue has been opened [here]. This is the place to discuss Tokio's
async/await plans and track progress.

## Tokio Trace

Visibility into execution behavior is critical when dealing with production
applications. This includes questions like:

- How many tasks are currently executing?
- Why did this task hang?
- Which tasks are taking longer than expected to poll, and what was the cause?

Right now, there is no good way to answer. To help improve the visibility and
debuggability of Tokio, we (mostly [hawkw]) are working on a major new feature:
Tokio Trace.

Tokio trace has been discussed in [this][trace-issue] issue. At a high level,
Tokio trace is a structured logging system in which log events cover periods of
time instead of a fixed point. "Period of time" is a crucial feature. The
instrumentation API will allow specifying when an event starts and when it ends.
By doing this, we can infer a parent / child relationship. Events that are
contained within other events are children, building out a tree.

Once the parent / child dependency is built, it becomes easy to do things like
filtering log events related to a buggy task. It also becomes possible to track
log events related to a buggy task across multiple tasks.

The second part of Tokio trace is the "structured" part. Instead of logging
basic strings, event data can be included using primitive types. For example, a
`Stream` combinator can be instrumented to track the number of messages
processed per `poll` by doing something like:

```rust,ignore
trace!(messages = num_processed);
```

where `num_processed` is a `usize`. Subscribers are able to receive the event
with the `usize` value.

By combining the parent/child structure and the structured logging, we can
answer the "Which tasks are taking longer than expected to poll, and what was
the cause?" question by tracking the 99.9th percentile of task poll durations,
and checking common causes for increased latencies, such as processing streams
with many messages without yielding. Many of these checks could be implemented
by tools that listen to the events emitted by Tokio trace.

More about this will be blogged about once the feature lands in Tokio proper.

## Teams

The final big thing for Tokio in 2019 is something that I've had on my mind for
a while. Tokio has grown in terms of functionality and adoption past a point
that is sane for me to manage, even with the group of amazing regular
contributors who make up an informal Tokio team. It is time to scale out Tokio
development and maintenance.

The strategy by which to do this is not new and I think Rust provides a good
model to follow. We will need to introduce a set of teams, each of which focus
on various aspects of Tokio.

The specifics regarding what teams will exist and who will be part of them are
still to be determined and will change over time. There will be blog posts
throughout the year discussing the evolution on that front.

We also need newcomers to help join in the effort of building and growing Tokio.
This includes us spending time mentoring. So, consider this a pre call to
action. Do you rely on Tokio at work or do you simply have an interest in Rust
asynchronous I/O? It doesn't matter if you feel like you don't have the
experience needed or are too much of a "newbie". Join us now in the [Gitter]
channel and help us figure out the process of transitioning to teams.

Finally, an extra big thanks to those who are going above and beyond, spending
significant time helping out with the Tokio dev, maintenance, docs, and helping
users in Gitter.
