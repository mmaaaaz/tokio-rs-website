title: 'Tokio alpha release with async & await'

We're pleased to announce [the release][crates] of the first Tokio alpha with
async & await support. This includes updating all of the Tokio crates to use
`std::future` instead of `futures` 0.1. It also includes adding `async fn`
versions of the APIs.

Get it by adding:

```toml
tokio = "=0.2.0-alpha.1"
```

to your `Cargo.toml` file. This is how an echo server is now written:

```rust,ignore
#![feature(async_await)]

use tokio::net::TcpListener;
use tokio::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:8080".parse()?;
    let mut listener = TcpListener::bind(&addr)?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = [0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(n) if n == 0 => return,
                    Ok(n) => n,
                    Err(e) => {
                        println!("failed to read from socket; err = {:?}", e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&buf[0..n]).await {
                    println!("failed to write to socket; err = {:?}", e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

# The road so far

Tokio was first announced almost exactly [three years ago][tokio-ann]. When
Tokio was first released, it contained a minimal, single-threaded, scheduler and
APIs for TCP. Since then, it has grown to include a multi-threaded work-stealing
scheduler, APIs for timers, TCP, UDP, UDS, file system access, signal handling,
managing child processes, high performance async aware channels, and more. All
this thanks to a [dedicated team of maintainers][maint] and an [active community
of contributors][contrib]. Tokio would not be where it is without you! Thank you
so much.

Tokio's goal has always been to provide an ergonomic library for writing
asynchronous applications for Rust without compromising on performance. The past
three years have been spent building out the Rust I/O ecosystem and discovering
idioms and patterns for writing asynchronous Rust. Over the past three years,
the Rust community built a vibrant ecosystem around Tokio.

Some libraries include:

- an [HTTP client and server][hyper] (with [HTTP/2.0 support][h2]).
- web frameworks ([warp][warp], [actix][actix]).
- a [QUIC][quinn] implementation.
- [composable components][tower] for building robust servers and clients.
- a [gRPC client and server][grpc]

Over the past three years, the Rust team has not been idle either. They have
been working tirelessly on a huge feature that will greatly improve the
experience of writing asynchronous code with Rust: [async & await
syntax][async_await]. This new syntax is about to land on Rust stable.

All of Tokio's iteration to date was done while maintaining API stability. Tokio
has not had a breaking release since the very first 0.1.0 release on September
9, 2016. Understandably, a long list of changes to make has been building up.
The introduction of async & await syntax is the right moment to make these
breaking changes.

# What we have now

Today's release of Tokio `0.2.0-alpha.1` with async & await updates all of
Tokio's components to use [`std::future`][std_future], and all usage of
`futures` 0.1 has been removed.

Changes include:

**Using async fns for asynchronous operations.**

When possible, `async fn` has been used to provide asynchronous operations. For
example, acceping sockets from a `TcpListener` is done with the async `accept`
function:

```rust,ignore
let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;
```

I/O operations are provided as `async` functions:

```rust,ignore
let n = socket.read(&mut buf).await?;

let n = socket.write(&buf).await?;
```

The same applies to most of the Tokio 0.2 APIs.

**Starting the Tokio runtime**

Setting the entry point of a Tokio application can now be done with a proc
macro:

```rust,ignore
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Tokio!");
}
```

Creating a runtime by hand is still supported. The proc macro just provides some
sugar. The equivalent application would be:

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let mut rt = Runtime::new().unwrap();
    rt.block_on(async {
        println!("Hello from Tokio!");
    });
}
```

There is also a proc macro for tests that will set up a current thread runtime
to run your tests:

```rust,ignore
#[tokio::test]
async fn my_test() {
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:8080".parse().unwrap();
    let mut listener = TcpListener::bind(&addr).unwrap();
    let addr = listener.local_addr().unwrap();

    // Connect to the listener
    TcpStream::connect(&addr).await.unwrap();
}
```

**Nightly only**

Because async & await are not available on the stable Rust channel yet, this
alpha release requires using nightly Rust. Tokio includes a
[rust-toolchain][rustup] file that tracks the nightly Tokio tests again.

# Towards a final release

This alpha release represents the first step towards the next iteration of
Tokio. Users are now able to experiment using Tokio and async & await syntax,
but nothing is set in stone.

The availability of async & await syntax is the perfect time to issue a major
revision of the full stack. All of Tokio's components require more changes,
including ecosystem crates such as [`mio`][mio], [`bytes`][bytes], and
[`tracing`][tracing]. Focus will be on tight integration and performance, i.e.
providing ergonomic high level APIs without sacrificing speed. Lessons learned
over the past three years will be applied. Follow up blog posts will cover these
changes in more detail as they happen.

As progress is made, alpha crates will be released. These releases will include
breaking changes. Progress can be tracked on the [issue tracker][issues].

Given the scope of the changes, it will take a few months before a final release
is ready. Estimating software release dates is hard, but let's aim for before
the end of the year.

There is a ton of work to done on code, testing, and documentation. As always,
your help is **greatly** appreciated! Check out the [issue tracker][issues] or
ping us on [Gitter][gitter]. We're always happy to mentor!
